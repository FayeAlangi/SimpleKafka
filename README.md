# A Simple Kafka Producer and Consumer Application

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Kafka producer and consumer in Java.


## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Kafka producer and consumer using Springboot and Java.
The producer publishes a message "hello kafka!" to a Kafka topic, while the consumer reads and processes the message.

## Setup


- Download Kafka Binary from [Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).
- Set up Kafka bins in the environment variable
- Run the Zookeeper and Kafka server in two separate terminals:

    - zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    - kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
  
Kafka Binary : kafka_2.13-3.7.0
