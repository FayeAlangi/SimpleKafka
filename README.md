## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Kafka producer and consumer using [brief description of the technology or library used]. The producer publishes messages to a Kafka topic, while the consumer reads and processes these messages.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Download Kafka Binary from [Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).
- Set up Kafka bins in the environment variable
- Run the Zookeeper and Kafka server in two separate terminals:

    - zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    - kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
  
Kafka Binary : kafka_2.13-3.7.0

    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd kafka-producer-consumer
    [command to install dependencies]
    ```

## Usage

1. Start Kafka server:

    ```bash
